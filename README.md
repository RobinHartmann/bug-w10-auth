# bug-w10-auth

A minimal working example for reproducing a crash on Windows 10 Mobile devices

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - A JavaScript run-time environment
* [Visual Studio 2015/2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/de/vs/) - Fully-featured IDE for Android, iOS, Windows, web, & cloud

### Installing

```Batchfile
npm i
.\node_modules\.bin\cordova platform add windows
```

### How to reproduce

1. Open `platforms/windows/CordovaApp.sln` in Visual Studio
1. Configure *CordovaApp.Windows10* as **Startup Project**
1. Run the project on a connected mobile device
1. Stop the debug session (the app doesn't crash during debugging)
1. Launch the app manually
1. Press *Send POST* (the device needs to successfully receive the response from `http://PutsReq.com`)

Now the authentication dialog should pop up. If the dialog isn't closed within ~5 seconds, the app will crash.

## About the response

For the dialog to pop up, the following conditions have to be met by the response:

* Status code needs to be `401`
* Header `WWW-Authenticate` needs to be present
* Header `WWW-Authenticate` needs to be configured for Basic Authentication (e.g. set to  `Basic realm="PutsReq.com"`)
